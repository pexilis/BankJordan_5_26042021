# Orinoco 1.0.1 

Hello, my name is Bank Jordan and I am a self-taught French developer passionate about challenges and new technologies 😀

This is the production version of the Orinoco project of the OpenClassRoooms platform. 

A French platform that trains the developers of tomorrow

The project consisted in realizing a complete MVP of the complete part of a basic E-Commerce site without payment system in order to evaluate the skills in Javascript ⚙️⚙️⚙️

Even if it was not requested, I chose to work in TDD to improve my agile skills 🚄🚄🚄
